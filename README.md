# Fibonacci Sequence in Python

This project demonstrates two implementations of the **Fibonacci sequence** in Python:
1. **Iterative approach** – efficient and uses a loop  
2. **Recursive approach** – elegant but less efficient  

---

## 🚀 How It Works
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones:  
**0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...**

- Iterative method uses a loop for efficiency.  
- Recursive method calls itself for simplicity.

## 📂 Files
- `fibonacci.py` → Contains both iterative and recursive implementations.

## ▶️ Usage
Run the Python file in your terminal:

```bash
python fibonacci.py
